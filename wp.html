Investors generally buy gold as a way of diversifying risks, especially through the use of futures contracts and derivatives. The gold market is subject to speculation and volatility as are other markets. Compared to other precious metals used for investment, gold has the most effective safe haven and hedging properties across a number of countries. <br /><br /> Much of the value of gold comes from its scarcity, that some gold bars, gold coins or gold jewellery (for instance) can be small enough to put in your pocket and most of all, from the metals' usefulness to industries. Cryptocurrency adapted some of gold's benefits by coming up with a bitcoin that's scarce, by introducing a digital coin that can be easily and effortlessly transmitted, and by creating a distributed, decentralized blockchain that aids business. Cryptocurrency also adds value by making the transactions of your money fast, secure, and transparent. <br /><br /> TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES INVESTMENT <em>premises:</em> <br /> TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES INVESTMENT gives you a cryptoasset (called GoldMine Token) whose value is based on Gold. This asset runs on a decentralised blockchain and provides the following benefits: <br /><br /> · It serves as a type of futures contract in there is a legal agreement to buy or sell the gold at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future <br /><br /> · You can hedge cryptotrading risks. <br /><br /> <em>If you invest in gold, you'll find thatGoldMine Tokens benefits you in the following ways:</em> <br /><br /> · GMT helps you use your gold-backed investments as credible collateral. <br /><br /> · You'll be able to trade gold quickly and easily. <br /><br /> · You'll gain higher returns from your gold funds as bullion prices rise. <br /><br /> GoldMineToken developers have a long history of working with gold and cryptocurrency. They also possess the marketing, programming, logical, technical, and operational skills needed to accomplish this project. <br /><br /> As a company, TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES INVESTMENT has been around since 2013 and is registered in Hong Kong, in the special administrative region of China, capable of providing convenient conditions for attracting private investments into a promising gold ore and copper exploration company. <br /><br /> TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES INVESTMENT has 3 active large scale exploration licenses and 1 active gold mine (&gt;1500 kg of gold above 35m level is confirmed by SGS laboratory) in Zambia. <br /><br /> Since 2013, we have invested heavily into exploration and geological research as well as obtaining licenses and local permits. We own a plot of 750km2 with a high percentage of gold and copper confirmed. <br /><br /> We have set ourselves the goal of becoming a transparent, successful gold ore and copper extraction business that will make its investors prosperous along the way. TECHNOLOGY ADVANCES INVESTMENT is sociable responsible company; we are building schools, hospitals, and villages for the local population of Zambia and investing 10% of its profits into the development of local communities and infrastructure.</div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec31433054" class="r t-rec t-rec_pt_0 t-rec_pb_0" style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px; " data-record-type="106" ><!-- T004 --><div class="t004"><div class="t-container "> <div class="t-col t-col_8 t-prefix_2"><div field="text" class="t-text t-text_md "><div style="font-size:24px;text-align:center;" data-customstyle="yes"><strong>Definitions</strong></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec30344610" class="r t-rec t-rec_pt_0 t-rec_pb_0" style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px; " data-record-type="106" ><!-- T004 --><div class="t004"><div class="t-container "> <div class="t-col t-col_8 t-prefix_2"><div field="text" class="t-text t-text_md "> <strong>Underlying asset</strong> means an asset on which the financial derivative (option) isbased. In our case this is the product, i.e. gold, and the derivative GoldMine Token. <br /><br /> <strong>Derivative or derivative financial instrument</strong> means a contract, under which theparties are entitled and/or undertake to make certain actions in respect of theunderlying asset. The contract represents an agreement between the two parties,whereunder they undertake or are entitled to transfer the underlying asset in theprescribed period at the agreed price. <br /><br /> <strong>GoldMine Token Derivative</strong> means an options contract for the sale of gold as a GMT Token intangible asset (see below), including an option (put option) on the buy-back of GMT in the prescribed period at the agreed price. <br /><br /> <strong>Crypto-economy</strong> means the social and economic relations of the digital society,which are focused on interaction based on network protocols.

Meanwhile, existing businesses andfinancial institutions will either have to adapt to the demands of the newtechnological lifestyle or become obsolete. <br /><br /> These events are typical for both economical and social processes. Against thebackground of negative sentiment, many investors are shifting towards cryptoinvestmentas an alternative field of wealth growth and preservation. For ourpurposes, these refer to the projects with fast payback, moderate risk, and theavailability of professional experience and support. <br /><br /> Until recently, investing in gold and copper production was not available to the private investors, which is why we decided to open a new page in the history of collective investment development. While many would consider the profitability of this business to be lucrative, due to the fact that the production costs of mining these minerals was shrouded in mystery; entering this business was always blocked by the various administrative barriers. <br /><br /> We are highly secured against losses caused by currencies and raw materials' cost volatility. For more than 3000 years, gold has remained the most reliable payment unit, the value of which is solid. The need for a gold as the capital preservation tool, as well as for electronic components and raw material for jewellery production, has faced growth during recent years, the continuation of which is inevitable. <br /><br /> All our licenses and certificates are available on our website, making it easy to verify their authenticity against the websites of Zambia's official ministries and departments. <br /><br /> A huge amount of work has been carried out in finding reliable suppliers of various services and equipment. For the first two years of preparation, we met many obstacles, but now we are moving very confidently to meet our goals, working hand-in-hand with the industry pros. <br /><br /></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec30344614" class="r t-rec t-rec_pt_15 t-rec_pb_15" style="padding-top:15px;padding-bottom:15px; " data-record-type="106" ><!-- T004 --><div class="t004"><div class="t-container "> <div class="t-col t-col_8 t-prefix_2"><div field="text" class="t-text t-text_md "><div style="font-size:22px;text-align:center;" data-customstyle="yes"> <strong>Project Summary</strong> <br /> <strong>Commercial Aspects of the Project</strong></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec30344616" class="r t-rec t-rec_pt_0 t-rec_pb_0" style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px; " data-record-type="106" ><!-- T004 --><div class="t004"><div class="t-container "> <div class="t-col t-col_8 t-prefix_2"><div field="text" class="t-text t-text_md "> The Project offers crowdfunded investments in the GoldMine Token derivative (seedefinition above), which is implemented as a financial instrument on the blockchain platform and is backed by the industrial commodity (gold). <br /><br /> A general overview of the GoldMine Token Project is shown in Picture <br /></div></div></div></div></div><div id="rec30344628" class="r t-rec t-rec_pt_15 t-rec_pb_15" style="padding-top:15px;padding-bottom:15px; " data-record-type="3" ><!-- T107 --><div class="t107"> <div class="t-align_center" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject"><meta itemprop="image" content="images/image003.png"> <img src="images/tild3930-3262-4562-b533-333061373064__-__empty__image001.png" data-original="images/image003.png" class="t107__widthauto t-img" imgfield="img" /> </div> </div></div><div id="rec30344620" class="r t-rec t-rec_pt_0 t-rec_pb_0" style="padding-top:0px;padding-bottom:0px; " data-record-type="106" ><!-- T004 --><div class="t004"><div class="t-container "> <div class="t-col t-col_8 t-prefix_2"><div field="text" class="t-text t-text_md "> Summary <br /><br /> Planned extraction capacity: 50-60 kg per month <br /><br /> Planned profit: 2 000 000 $ per month <br /><br /> The total number of tokens - 1 200 000 GMT <br /><br /> Price for 1 GoldMine Token (GMT) approx. 3,2$<br /><br /> 1 ETH - 100 GMT <br /><br /><br /> Pre-Sale discount – 50% <br /><br /> Pre-Sale САР – 2 000 ЕТН <br /><br /> 1 ЕТН – 200 GMT <br /><br /> Total number of tokens on Pre-Sale – 400 000 GMT <br /><br /><br /> ICO CAP - 800 000 GMT <br /><br /> 1 ETH - 100 GMT <br /><br /><br /><br /> After ICO all pre-sale participants will get 15% of Ether collected during ICO - and you still keep your tokens <br /><br /> Buy-back of GoldMine Token options will be made ten months after the end of the ICO inan amount equal to not less than $450000 per month.

Nevertheless, there are many villages that still live without electricity, without communication with the outside world, medical care and without education for children. <br /><br /> Our project will open up new opportunities for hundreds of local residents who will get jobs at our mine and factory, but more significantly is that hundreds of children living in the surrounding areas will receive a new school, a medical aid and solar batteries for their villages. We decided not to wait for the start of production and getting profit, we found it important to spend part of our own investment funds to buy a school bus in order to take children to a distant school and provide this school with additional educational supplies. In the future, at least 15% of the company's revenues will be invested in the development of the region's infrastructure in order to make life of the local community more convenient and civilized. Special focus will be on the development of education and health services for children of forest villages.<br /> Thus, joining our project, you not only invest in business, but also support the development of a whole region of Kasempa in the Republic of Zambia.</div></div></div></div></div></div><!--/allrecords--><!-- Tilda copyright.
